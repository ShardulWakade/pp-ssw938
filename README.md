Its 11:57pm now and I just finsihed the compilation process on linux. I have been developing on windows all this time.

I might try to still figure out how to get it running on linux to make things more convinient for the grader.

I am going to keep the above message for now. Note that I am not changing any code at this point from any furthur commits.

Since I used packages, I need to figure out how to set up the classpath on linux. I also might put in helper documents after the deadline so that the grader can have an easier time.
Again, I am not adding adding any new "code" after 11:59 pm.
